# Airbnb-Data-Science-Project
Project Details

Background & Project Goal
Airbnb is an online platform, where people post their listings and rent their apartments or spare rooms to guests. According to the Airbnb website, the marketplace monetizes this process by taking a 3% commission from hosts and 0% - 20% from guests. As the prices of the listings increase, the revenues of Airbnb also increase. In our project, we would like to understand how successful Airbnb is in maximizing value for all the stakeholders and itself. We aim to develop models for understanding:
1)	How can hosts make the most out of it?
2)	Can guests find what they are looking for easily and accurately?

Data Sources
Inside Airbnb provides publicly available Airbnb data for non-commercial entities to perform analysis on certain factors like understanding residential housing market. The link for the data is: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. Among all the cities provided on Inside Airbnb website, I decided to use NYC data for my analysis. It consists of over 47,500 listings and more than 1 million reviews.

Methodology
1)	Data Exploration on the listings, calendar, and reviews data.
2)	Regression analysis on the price of listings.
3)	Sentiment analysis on the reviews data.
4)	Build a recommendation interface to help users find the best listing in a certain area that fits their expectation in terms of price.
